This Maven project is needed to extract the coverage targets for the test generator given the class under test (`cut`) for the subject application (generated by the [poparsing](https://github.com/matteobiagiola/FSE19-submission-material-DIG/tree/master/poparsing) project).

The program takes as input the path to the `cut` and outputs the lines in the source code that the test generation has to cover.
Each output line to cover represents a transition in the respective [navigation graph](https://github.com/matteobiagiola/FSE19-submission-material-DIG/tree/master/graphs). Hence, covering all the lines means achieving transition coverage of the navigation graph.
